/// Launch-environment seam for UI tests and local simulator review. Compiled
/// only into Debug builds; Release binaries contain none of it. Every scenario
/// composes synthetic data and in-process fakes, never a real account or the
/// production server: the app talks to `FakeQBankServer` and keeps its session
/// in memory, so the Keychain is never touched. Settings kept on the phone, such
/// as Look and the lock, live in their own defaults suite, and saved courses and
/// unsent answers in their own folder, `Application Support/QBankUITest`; both
/// are emptied at launch.
///
/// Supported environment variables:
/// - `QB_UITEST_SCENARIO`: the scenario to start in, one of `Scenario`'s raw
///   values. Absent means a normal launch.
/// - `QB_UITEST_KEEP_PHONE_SETTINGS`: `1` keeps the suite from the previous
///   launch, to check that a setting survives a relaunch.
/// - `QB_UITEST_KEEP_PHONE_DATA`: `1` keeps the courses saved and the answers
///   left waiting by the previous launch, to check that they survive a relaunch.
///   The fake server starts afresh either way.
/// - `QB_UITEST_NETWORK`: `offline` starts without a network; absent or
///   `online` starts with one.
/// - `QB_UITEST_DEVICE_OWNER`: how the device answers the Face ID lock, one of
///   `DebugDeviceOwner.Kind`'s raw values, such as `face-id`. Absent means the
///   simulator's own Face ID or passcode, for a look by hand.
/// - `QB_UITEST_PASSKEYS`: the device's passkeys, one of
///   `DebugPasskeyAuthenticator.Kind`'s raw values, such as `synced`. Absent
///   means the system's passkey sheet, which cannot reach the fake server's
///   passkeys, for a look by hand.
///
/// While the app runs, a test turns the network off and on by posting the
/// Darwin notifications `networkOfflineNotification` and
/// `networkOnlineNotification` (see `DebugNetwork`), sets the app's Look by
/// posting `lookNotification(_:)` (see `DebugLook`), and makes the device
/// confirm or refuse her with `ownerConfirmsNotification` and
/// `ownerRefusesNotification` (see `DebugDeviceOwner`). On iPad, it opens
/// another window with `newWindowNotification` (see `DebugWindows`).
