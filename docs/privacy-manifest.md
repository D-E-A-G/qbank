# Privacy manifest and App Store privacy labels

Two Apple declarations say what data QBank handles. They must agree with each other and with [privacy-policy.md](privacy-policy.md):

- the **privacy manifest**, `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`, a file inside the app target that ships in every build;
- the **App Privacy answers** (the "nutrition labels") the owner fills in once in App Store Connect, under the app's App Privacy page.

This file is the source for both. It describes the app at TestFlight parity (phases 1a to 1e of the plan), with the Face ID lock, Import, and passkeys (phase 3) and Make questions (phase Q). Any change that sends a new kind of data to the server, adds a third-party SDK, or uses a new required-reason API updates this file, the manifest, and the policy in the same pull request.

## Why these answers

Apple counts data as **collected** when it leaves the device and is kept longer than it takes to answer the request. QBank's server keeps your account, sessions, answers, and progress, so those are collected. Data that stays on the phone (the offline copy, the look setting) is not collected.

Everything collected is **linked** to you, because it is stored under your account. Nothing is used for **tracking**: no ads, no data brokers, no joining with other companies' data. The only purpose is **App Functionality**: signing in and keeping your progress.

## Collected data types

| App Store Connect category | Data type | Manifest key | What it is in QBank | Linked | Tracking | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Contact Info | Email Address | `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypeEmailAddress` | the account's sign-in email | yes | no | App Functionality |
| Identifiers | User ID | `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypeUserID` | the server's account id that every answer is stored under | yes | no | App Functionality |
| User Content | Photos or Videos | `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypePhotosorVideos` | Make questions: the photos she takes or picks of her notes, slides, or practice questions, sent on to Anthropic's Claude API to read them and deleted from the server once read; the text read from them stays in the set's record | yes | no | App Functionality |
| User Content | Other User Content | `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypeOtherUserContent` | answers, guesses, per-question progress, the Review list, exam picks and scores; for Make questions, the notes she pastes and the file she picks, sent on like the photos; their text stays in the set's record | yes | no | App Functionality |
| Usage Data | Product Interaction | `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypeProductInteraction` | study-session start and end times and the last-opened course (Apple lists "saved place" under this type) | yes | no | App Functionality |

Answer these in App Store Connect exactly this way: "Yes, we collect data from this app", then the five types above, each "linked to the user", "not used for tracking", purpose "App Functionality" only.

### Considered and not declared

| Data | Why not declared |
|---|---|
| Password | Apple's list of data types has no password type. The app sends it only to sign in, and the server keeps a one-way hash. |
| Passkey | Apple's list has no credential type either. A passkey's private key never leaves the device; saving one sends the server its public key and credential id, with the name the app gives it (the device, "iPhone" or "iPad"), and the server keeps them, with when it was saved and what the device reported about it, only to sign her in. Signing in sends a signature over a one-time challenge. |
| Name | The account name is set by the owner on the server, not collected by the app. Declare **Name** if a later version lets you type or change it in the app. |
| IP address and user agent of a session | The server's sign-in library records them with each session; QBank reads them for nothing. Apple says to declare an IP address by how it is used (location, device ID, diagnostics), and QBank uses it for none of these. Cleaner still: a server task turns that recording off (see [release.md](release.md)), and this row then goes away. |
| Crash data, performance data, other diagnostics | The app has no crash or analytics SDK and sends no diagnostics. TestFlight crash reports and feedback are collected by Apple, and Apple says developers are not responsible for disclosing data Apple collects. |
| Audio | Not read. |
| An imported question file | It becomes shared course content, not personal data. The export file goes where you send it; QBank never receives it. |
| Purchases, financial info, health, location, contacts, browsing, search history, sensitive info | Not handled. |

### When later phases change the answers

| Phase | Change |
|---|---|
| 3 Face ID lock | shipped: nothing is collected. iOS checks Face ID, Touch ID or the passcode and tells the app only whether it matched; the on-off setting stays on the device. |
| 3 Passkeys | shipped: nothing new is collected that Apple's labels count (see Passkey above). The answer to the offer to save one stays on the device, in `UserDefaults`. |
| 3 Import | shipped: an imported question file becomes shared course content; it is not personal data, so no new type. Re-check if the file can carry personal notes. |
| Q Make questions (the accounts the server allows) | shipped: **Photos or Videos** and **Other User Content** (notes, files) declared above; the policy names Anthropic. |
| 4 Free on this phone | data in on-phone mode is never sent anywhere and is not collected; the signed-in mode keeps the answers above. |

## `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`

The app target carries this file at `QBank/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`. The project's folder-synchronized `QBank` group copies it into the app bundle; the test targets and the packages do not. Kun's Eddie's Wallet ships the same shape at `EddysWallet/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`.

## Required-reason APIs

Apple rejects an upload that calls one of these API groups without a declared reason. Declare only what the code really calls; check with a search of the app's sources before each release.

| API group | Expected in QBank | Reason code | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| User defaults (`UserDefaults`, `@AppStorage`) | yes: the look setting, the Face ID lock, the answer to the passkey offer | `CA92.1` | read and written only by the app itself |
| File timestamp (`creationDate`, `modificationDate`, `stat`) | only if the offline store reads file dates | `C617.1` | files inside the app's own container |
| System boot time (`systemUptime`, `mach_absolute_time`) | only if a timer measures elapsed time this way | `35F9.1` | time between events inside the app; never sent off the phone |
| Disk space (`volumeAvailableCapacity...`) | only if the offline store checks free space before saving | `E174.1` | to avoid writing when the phone is full |
| Active keyboards | no | | |

The exam timer is ruled by the server's clock (`serverNow`), so it should not need the boot-time group.

A search of the app and of `Packages/QBankKit` and `Packages/QBankDesign` finds `UserDefaults` only, in the look setting, the Face ID lock, and the passkey offer. The manifest declares that group with `CA92.1` and no other required-reason group.

## Related build settings

- **Export compliance:** the app uses only Apple's HTTPS, which is exempt. Set `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` to `NO` in the app's Info.plist so App Store Connect stops asking on every build.
- **No tracking prompt:** the app never shows the App Tracking Transparency prompt and has no `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription`.
- **Usage descriptions** (`NS...UsageDescription`) are added only with the feature that needs them. Make questions' Take photo uses the camera, so the app carries `NSCameraUsageDescription`. Its photo picker (`PhotosPicker`) runs outside the app and hands over only the photos she picks, so there is no photo library usage description.
